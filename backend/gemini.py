    # Generate a prompt for the Gemini API based on the query and dataset context
    prompt = f"""Generate a Python code that executes automatically based on the following requirements. Avoid any extra explanations about querying of data or unrelated details.

    Assumptions:

    The latest versions of Plotly, NumPy, Pandas, and PyMongo are installed.
    The dataset is stored in a MongoDB collection with the following details:
        mongo_uri = "mongodb+srv://bhuvaneshg:deepakbhuvi@cluster0.e2m47pj.mongodb.net/HigherStudies?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0"
        db_name = "HigherStudies"
        collection_name = "StudentData"

    The dataset context is provided as {dataset_context}.
    The Python version being used is 3.12.
    Do not use something like iplot; use other tools from Pandas, NumPy, or Plotly.
    Task Instructions:

    Code Execution:
        Write Python code that performs operations based on the provided dataset context and the query: {query}.
        
        If the operation is a read operation (query contains "read", "fetch", or similar keywords):
            - The code should produce:
                - A visualization that is integral to answering the query and highlights key insights.
                - A detailed explanation in query_answer['1'] that complements the visualization with only details about quantitative data and not explaining querying data or other unrelated details.

        If the operation is a create, update, or delete operation (query contains "create", "update", "delete", or similar keywords):
            - The code should not perform the requested operation and it should produce that this operation is violated to perform via chatbot.

        If the query is a general or casual query (e.g., "hello", "hi", "bye", or similar):
            - The code should provide a response in query_answer['1'] that addresses the query in a friendly, conversational manner. The response should be in plain text and should be respectful, addressing the bot as "QuestBot".

    Explanation (query_answer['1']):
        Provide a clear, structured explanation in query_answer['1'] that:
            - Directly answers the query using the dataset, including computations like summing, aggregation, filtering, or statistical analysis as needed.
            - Provides context to the visualization by describing what it represents quantitatively without unwanted information about the query and how it is fetched.
            - Is formatted as a user-friendly string that non-experts can easily understand.
            - Is in plain text format in paragraph form.
        For general queries, provide an explanation that is friendly and engaging, as QuestBot is a conversational bot.

    Visualization (query_answer['2']):
        If the query is a read operation:
            - Use Plotly to create a chart that complements the explanation and directly answers the query. This chart must:
                - Be stored as a Plotly figure object in query_answer['2'].
                - Be well-formatted with a relevant chart type (e.g., bar chart for comparisons, line chart for trends, scatter plot for relationships etc.).
                - Include clear and appropriately scaled x-axis and y-axis labels, with a descriptive title.
                - If needed, include aggregated or processed data to enhance its relevance and clarity.

    Data Handling:
        Ensure that the dataset is processed in a way that:
            - Aligns with the queryâ€™s intent and dataset context.

    Output:
        - For read operations: The explanation in query_answer['1'] may include summaries, aggregations, or other calculations to address the query comprehensively. The visualization in query_answer['2'] serves as a visual representation that complements and enhances the explanation.
        - For create, update, or delete operations: The explanation in query_answer['1'] should be that the operation is violated to perform via chatbot.
        - For general queries: The explanation in query_answer['1'] should be a friendly and conversational response from QuestBot, providing an answer to casual questions or greetings.

    query_answer = {{
        '1': str,  # Explanatory string for the query result, including calculations, filtering, and reasoning or operation details or friendly response
        '2': 'Plotly figure object'   # Plotly figure object containing the generated visualization (only for read operations)
    }}

Ensure that the code adheres strictly to these instructions, producing outputs that are aligned with the query and dataset context, and that QuestBot responds conversationally to general queries.
